# OSCP Certification

The primary purpose of this repository is to contain resources that will be useful for the PEN-200 course and subsequently the OSCP Certification.

I have an [unofficial OSCP Approved tools list](https://falconspy.medium.com/unofficial-oscp-approved-tools-b2b4e889e707) that's been on Medium that I more or less stopped updating. That list will be transferred to this repository where it will be maintained hopefully by myself and others.

Please find the resource you are looking for in its respective folder above. There you can find more information about what tools are available and if any of them have downloads like templates, you can find the download there as well.

# OSCP Certification

## Disclaimer

The following is an unofficial list of OSCP approved tools that were posted in the [InfoSec Prep Discord Server](https://discord.gg/infosecprep) and found on the internet.

Please note it is by no means a complete list of all tools. These are merely tools suggested by other users that are deemed “approved” for the exam.

There will be some tools on here that were not suggested on the Discord server as well.

As a general rule of thumb, if a tool can auto-exploit, it is banned on the exam.

The list is subject to additions/removals as time goes by.

## About Repo

The primary purpose of this repository is to contain resources that will be useful for the PEN-200 course and subsequently the OSCP Certification.

I have an [unofficial OSCP Approved tools list](https://falconspy.medium.com/unofficial-oscp-approved-tools-b2b4e889e707) that's been on Medium that I more or less stopped updating. That list will be transferred to this repository where it will be maintained hopefully by myself and others.

Please find the resource you are looking for in its respective folder above. There you can find more information about what tools are available and if any of them have downloads like templates, you can find the download there as well.
